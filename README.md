### About 
Sail is an Arduino powered camera slider designed to give videographers smooth cinematic shots of their subjects. I am currently developing a mobile application that will allow users to have all of the functionality typically only found on high-end camera sliders.

### To build your own Sail slider you will need the following materials/tools: 

* A 3D printer
* An Arduino Uno R3 and USB cable 
* An HC-05 Bluetooth Serial Pass-through Module
* 5mm Steel rod and something to cut it to size 
* An L293D Motor Driver Shield
* 2 X IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Modules 
* GT2 Belt (Typically obtainable from 3D printer suppliers)
* A GT2 Pulley  and Idler 
* An SB to TTL Serial Adapter
* 2 X stepper motors and driver boards(28BYJ-48)
